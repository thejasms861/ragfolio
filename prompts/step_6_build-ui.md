1.  **Extract Core Identity**: Identify the professional name, current role, and a high-level value proposition from the source text.
2.  **Populate Components**:
    *   **Hero**: Replace generic greetings with the name and a compelling headline that summarizes the professional's primary expertise.
    *   **About**: Summarize the professional's background, years of experience, and key pillars of their expertise in 2-3 concise, impactful sentences.
    *   **Header/Footer**: Ensure the branding name is updated throughout.
    *   **Skills**: Extract specific technical skills and categorize them logically (e.g., Languages, Backend, Frontend, Cloud/Tools).
    *   **Experience**: Detail the work history, prioritizing significant achievements, technologies used, and responsibilities for each role.
    *   **Projects**: Extract project names, descriptions, and the technology stacks used to build them.
    *   **Education**: Note degrees, institutions, and any significant honors or awards.

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

- **Accuracy**: Use ONLY information found in the provided source text. Do not invent details.
- **Tone**: Maintain a sophisticated, professional, and innovative tone.
- **Preserve Structure**: Do NOT change the JSX structure, the Tailwind classes, the `framer-motion` animations, or the navigation `id` attributes (e.g., `id="experience"`). Only update the text/content within the tags.
- **Aesthetics**: Ensure the final output fits naturally within the premium dark-themed UI.

Provide the full code for each modified component (`Hero.tsx`, `About.tsx`, `Skills.tsx`, `Experience.tsx`, `Projects.tsx`, `Education.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`) as drop-in replacements.
